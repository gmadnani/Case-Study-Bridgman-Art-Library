# Case-Study-Bridgman-Art-Library

## Instructions
* analyse this Business Case and design a Conceptual ER Model in Chen’s notation (can be hand drawn) and a Physical ER Model for a MySQL Relational Database in Crow’s foot notation

* You may list any assumptions you have made about the model on a separate page. There is a 400-word limit for assumptions. Assumptions must not be used to simplify the assignment, but only to justify your decision about any ambiguity in the case study.
